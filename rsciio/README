Definition of a read/write plugin
---------------------------------

Each read/write plugin resides in a separate directory (the name should be
descriptive of the file type/manufacturer) containing the following files:

    - __init__.py 
      May usually be empty

    - specifications.yaml
      The characteristics of the IO plugin in yaml format:

	    format_name: <String>
        description: <String>
        full_support: <Bool>	# Whether all the Hyperspy features are supported
        # Recognised file extension
        file_extensions: <Tuple of string>
        default_extension: <Int>	# Index of the extension that will be used by default
        # Writing capabilities
        writes: <Bool>
        # Support for non-uniform axis
        non_uniform_axis = <Bool>

    - api.py
      Python file that implements the actual reader. The IO functionality should
      be interfaced with the following functions:

      * A function called `file_reader` with at least one attribute: `filename`

      * (optional) A function called `file_writer` with at least two attributes: 
        `filename` and `object2save` in that order.

It is advisable to clone the files an existing plugin when initiating a new plugin.
