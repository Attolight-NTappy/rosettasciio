Reading data generated by HyperSpy using other software packages
================================================================

The following scripts may help reading data generated by HyperSpy using
other software packages.


.. _import-rpl:

ImportRPL Digital Micrograph plugin
-----------------------------------

This Digital Micrograph plugin is designed to import Ripple files into Digital Micrograph.
It is used to ease data transit between DigitalMicrograph and HyperSpy without losing
the calibration using the extra keywords that HyperSpy adds to the standard format.

When executed it will ask for 2 files:

#. The riple file with the data  format and calibrations
#. The data itself in raw format.

If a file with the same name and path as the riple file exits
with raw or bin extension it is opened directly without prompting.
ImportRPL was written by Luiz Fernando Zagonel.

HDF5 reader plugin for Digital Micrograph
-----------------------------------------

This Digital Micrograph plugin is designed to import HDF5 files and like the
`ImportRPL` script above, it can be used to easily transfer data from HyperSpy to
Digital Micrograph by using the HDF5 hyperspy format (``hspy`` extension).

Download ``gms_plugin_hdf5`` from its `Github repository <https://github.com/niermann/gms_plugin_hdf5>`__.


.. _hyperspy-matlab:

readHyperSpyH5 MATLAB Plugin
----------------------------

This MATLAB script is designed to import HyperSpy's saved HDF5 files (``.hspy`` extension).
Like the Digital Micrograph script above, it is used to easily transfer data
from HyperSpy to MATLAB, while retaining spatial calibration information.

Download ``readHyperSpyH5`` from its `Github repository <https://github.com/jat255/readHyperSpyH5>`__.
